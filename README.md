# Summary
In this thesis, the aim was to identify the tactical patterns of football teams using an
unsupervised machine learning approach. We considered the passes that every team
made as input to the k-means and Hierarchical clustering models to classify the teams
into clusters. In the five top European leagues. The top 6 teams had most of their
matches clustered in one cluster that was characterized by the high overall number of
passes, the domination of the middle area of the football pitch, and the dependence on
short passes to attack, Our results agree with. For the Premier Legue, Ligue 1 and
the Bundesliga the league winner had different tactical style than other teams. While
in Serie A Napoli, the runner-up had this unique play style and for La Liga Barcelona
(winner) and Real Madrid (third) had a similar play style.
